486 careful handmade pixel art icons based on a 24x24 grid and `currentColor` fills. All icons were made individually using rectangles to recreate a non-anti-aliased look. It makes use of subtle padding for each icon. It is recommended to use the icons with a width and height of 24px, 48px, 72px, 96px because on all scales outside of 24px the icons will appear blurry.
